<br> Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Iyan Sugiarto. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science. I studied at a university, more precisely at Kuningan University, West Java. 
<br> ðŸ”­ Currently learning about data science, frontend and how to play among us.
<br> ðŸŒ± I am passionate about contribuing, being part of a community (that's why i'm in so many...) and music.
<br> âš¡ Recently my projects are kid-related, while I am studying I find something nice to do for them.
<br> For more info, you can visit my [porftolio](https://emys-alb.github.io/)
